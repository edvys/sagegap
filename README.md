# SageGap

SageGap is a canonical continuity platform designed to preserve and connect a child’s educational, medical, and social history across systems—governed by families, trusted by institutions, and augmented by AI.

## Vision
Modern systems fragment a child’s story across schools, providers, and agencies. SageGap creates a single, longitudinal source of truth that compounds in value over time.

## Core Concepts
- Canonical Egg: the child’s protected, longitudinal record
- Family Sovereignty: families control access and context
- Stakeholder Huddles: schools, providers, and mentors collaborate without fragmenting truth
- Time-Based Moat: continuity cannot be recreated once lost

## Status
Early-stage build. Architecture, governance, and pilot design in progress.
